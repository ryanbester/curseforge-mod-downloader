# Curseforge Mod Downloader

Ever downloaded a modpack from Curseforge only to find that there are no mod JARs, just a manifest? Look no further as this tool will simply download those mods for you.

## Usage

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system first.

1. Download download-mods.py
2. Enter your manifest.json path and CurseForge API key into the commented fields
3. Run the script with `python3 download-mods.py`.

**Note: The mods will be downloaded into the current directory,** so make sure to run the script in a subdirectory to avoid losing files.
